: Facial expression recognition plays a vital role in understanding human emotions and behavior. In the
context of Autism spectrum disorder childrens, accurate recognition of their facial expressions holds significant
potential for aiding diagnosis, treatment, and communication. This abstract presents an overview of a machinelearningbased approach to facial expression recognition for children with the Autism Spectrum Disorder. They face challenges
in effectively expressing their emotions verbally, which underscores the importance of nonverbal cues such as facial
expressions. In proposed work, Machine learning algorithms will implement for acquiring better accuracy for 
recognizing facial expressions, offering a non-intrusive and objective way to assess emotional states. Bench mark
dataset available online along with our own -prepared dataset containing images of Autism spectrum disorder childrens 
exhibiting a range of expressions will use for model training, testing and validation.
